<p>This single tune ABC to notation converter was developed by <a href="http://michaeleskin.com" target="_blank">Michael Eskin</a>.</p>
<p>The converter can generate standard notation as well as tab output for mandolin, note names, standard tuned guitar, DADGAD guitar, and tin whistle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The converter uses open source Javascript libraries and forks of other projects:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.franziskaludwig.de/abctransposer/" target="_blank">Jens Wollschlager's abc transposer</a> My code is a fork of Jens Wollschlager's original version.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.abcjs.net/">abcjs</a> by Paul Rosen and Gregory Dyke to convert abc to sheet music.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image">html-to-image</a> is used to prepare the html sheet music for PDF conversion.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF">jsPDF</a> is used to actually create the PDF.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/OMerkel/tin_whistle/tree/master/res/font">Tin Whistle Fingering Font</a> by Paul Merke is used to generate the whistle tabs.</p> 
<p>Without these free resources this project would not have been possible.</p>
